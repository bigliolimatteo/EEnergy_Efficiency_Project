      "survey_description": "This research study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the Smart Specialisation Program by rigorously evaluating the adoption of digital technologies by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Romania's North-East region.  \nThe program is designed to provide financial assistance to eligible SMEs, facilitating their acquisition of ICT hardware, development or adaptation of software applications/licenses, acquisition of AI systems, website development, and enhancement of IT infrastructure. By comparing randomly selected program firms and non-selected comparison firms, we seek to establish causal relationships between digitalization and its corresponding outcomes, while also distinguishing the effects for various types of firms.\n\nNon-refundable financial support will be provided to eligible SMEs, with a maximum project contribution of 90% of the eligible investment value.  \nTotal financial allocation is of 51.4 millions Euros and is carried out by launching calls for projects (min 15.000 Euros, max 100.000 Euros per firm).  \nThe focus is on increasing digital intensity, supporting the use of digital tools, equipment, and services by creating internet pages, digital promotion, cloud hosting services, e-commerce, digitalization of communication with clients, data collection, buying ICT hardware, and developing or adapting software applications/licenses.\n\nThe following 10 questions regard your beliefs on, what is called in technical terms, the intention-to-treat effect (ITT). It is the effect of BEING OFFERED the full program, regardless of whether or not a firm decides to participate. It is simply the mean difference of the outcomes for the firms that get the financial assistance to get digitalized, compared to the firms that do not.\nIn other words, you will be asked what you think it is the likely impact of the program for the firms that are offered the intervention, compared to those that do not participate to the program."
